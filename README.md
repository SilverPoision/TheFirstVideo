# TheFirstVideo
TheFirsVideo aims to manage your Youtube channels so that you can set your channel priorities and watch latest videos from the channels you want to watch first. TheFirstVideo is a Node-Next app that uses SSR to pre-render the page content and provide user a better response time and thus a better UX.

## Interesting facts about this project:
1. It is totally build with taking security in consideration and thus is more robust to bugs and vulnerability that can be used to harm the user's data and privacy, you can asses the security by reading the code, there's always a different approach used.
2. The priority sorting algorithm is sometime interesting that you may wanna see.
3. The whole project focuses on writing more code on my own and using less libs and you can find it while reading the code.
4. The frontend authentication is something that is truly raw without using any libs, as most of the dev's prefer next-auth lib while implementing authentication in NextJS, I wrote it on my own because I believe that next-auth doesn't follow some of the security best practices and I am looking forward to contribute in next-auth lib and handle the security part.

###Let me know if you find any kind of bugs and issues and report them via the issues tab, I will be more than happy to fix them.
